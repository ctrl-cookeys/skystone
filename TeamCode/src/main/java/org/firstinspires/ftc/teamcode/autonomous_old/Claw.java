/**

 TASK:
 1. Implement the constructor, grabStone and releaseStone methods below
 2. You can use the Arm.java sample (from the autonomous folder) to get an idea on what you may need to do
    Is the claw on the robot using a DcMotor or a Servo?
 3. Note: this is for the autonomous mode, so the robot needs to automatically grab the stone
 4. See the old code from League 2 CBotTeleOpDriveHoldArm_Old.java to get an idea

 5. Add your notes or questions, if any in this section
